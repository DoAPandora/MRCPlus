# MRCPlus
Transforms Oculus's MRC system into a spectator camera with customized FOV and smoothing.

This is intended as a quest adaptation of Camera2/CameraPlus.
## Important:
**Getting MRC to work is tricky; please [follow this guide](https://github.com/Raemien/MRCPlus/wiki/Getting-Started)!**

This mod requires a PC to receive streamed footage. If you're looking to record footage directly onto the quest, consider using Henwill8's Replay mod.

Mixed Reality Capture offers a nice alternative to casting, at the cost of being difficult to set up. As such, I've prepared [a few guides](https://github.com/Raemien/MRCPlus/wiki/) to help with the initial setup and troubleshooting.
