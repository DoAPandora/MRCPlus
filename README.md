MRCPlus

MRCPlus Transforms Oculus's MRC system into a spectator camera with customized FOV and smoothing.

This is intended as a quest adaptation of Camera2/CameraPlus.

Important:
MRCPlus is in early stages, as time go's on there will be more improvements to come. THIS IS MRCPLUS JUST UPDATED SO GIVE CREDIT HERE https://github.com/Raemien/MRCPlus

This mod requires a PC to receive streamed footage. If you're looking to record footage directly onto the quest, consider using the Replay mod.

Mixed Reality Capture offers a nice alternative to casting, at the cost of being difficult to set up. As such, Raemien has prepared a few guides that are right here https://github.com/Raemien/MRCPlus/wiki to help with the initial setup and troubleshooting.
