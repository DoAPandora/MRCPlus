# MRCPlus
A spiritual port of the CameraPlus PC mod, this mod transforms Oculus's Mixed Reality Capture system into a spectator camera with customized FOV and smoothing.
## Important:
There's a lot to unpack here, so I'll note down a few ideas to write about later:
- Requires a PC with OBS and Oculus's MRC setup application.
- ^ Recommend Henwill8's Replay mod if this is not practical.
- A slow or unstable network connection may impact the VR framerate.
- Quest 2 is recommended for quality and performance.
## Configuration:
More details coming soon!
